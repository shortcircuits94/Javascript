Lab 13 : Working with DOM elements II 

1. Copy the main.js file from lab 12. Delete the lines (or comment them out) 
   that set the markers and the colours.

2. In the init() function, use a method to get all <td> elements. 

3. Loop through the nodelist and add an onclick attribute pointing to a new 
   function called squareClicked() in the js file. Pass the argument 'this' 
   ie: squareClicked(this) so you can work with the element in the function.

4. Create the squareClicked() function. It will accept one argument called "sqr".
   In the function add a statement to show an alert dialog with a message in it.
