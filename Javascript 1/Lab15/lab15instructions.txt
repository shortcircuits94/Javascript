Lab 15 : Working with DOM elements IV

1. Modify your code from Lab 14 to create the div elements with DOM manipulation 
   (createElement, appendElement, etc.)
   
2. Modify the new game button to use DOM traversal and manipulation to 
    - navigate through all children of the <tbody> element
    - remove all divs from the table through DOM manipulation (not innerHTML)

3. In the init() method, use DOM traversal to add a button before the "New Game" 
   button labelled "Set Banner". This button will call a new function called
   setBanner().
   
4. In the setBanner function:
    - Prompt the user to input a title for the game.
    - Create an h1 element to contain this input.  
    - Securely (careful of HTML) insert the input into the h1 element and add it
	  to the page immediately after the opening body tag.
