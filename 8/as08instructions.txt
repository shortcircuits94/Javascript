Assignment 8: use DOM manipulation to add save functionality to the game

Start with your Lab 16 solution.

1. To make sure nothing happens when the user clicks on a square that
   already contains a marker:
    - remove the onclick attribute from the clicked TD element in the 
	  squareClicked function.
	- add the onclick attribute to each TD when setting a new game
	- remove the onclick attribute from the each TD that has a marker
	  when loading a game.

2. Modify the squareClicked function so that it will:
	- make sure the square does not have an X or O in it
    - determine which player's turn it is
	- create a new DIV element with the correct class and place it in the 
	  clicked TD (don't use innerHTML)
	- change the current player
	
3. In the setBanner function, check to see if a banner has already been set
   and delete the old one before setting the new one.
