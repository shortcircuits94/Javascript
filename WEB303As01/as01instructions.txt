# Assignment 1 : jQuery

Start with the files given.

1. Include jQuery and script.js in the HTML file.

2. Edit the existing script.js file. Write your code inside a jQuery
   document ready function.

3. Create an event handler to run whenever the salary and percent 
   fields have changed ("change" event).

4. In the event handler calculate the amount you can spend on 
   gadgets and insert it into the span#spend element with a dollar sign.

5. Test your code by entering values in both fields.

6. Try using the "keyup" event instead of "change". 
   What's the difference?

7. Use the built in round() method to round the number before dividing
   it by 100. That will get rid of extra decimal places.

Math assistance -- The formula for this is:
		salary * percent / 100
