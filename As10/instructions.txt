Assignment 10 - Event Delegation

Start with a copy of the finished code from lab 18 or the included JS file.

Let's make it a bit more user friendly.

1. After inserting a new item, clear the input field.

2. If the user presses the enter key, perform the same action as clicking the 
   plus button.

3. Check to make sure that the user entered something into the input field 
   adding it to the list.
   
4. When the user clicks on the heading, show a prompt to allow them to change the 
   title. Make sure they entered something before changing it.
