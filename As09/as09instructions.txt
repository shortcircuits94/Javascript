Make a copy of the finished lab 17 javascript file or use the included solution.

1. When an existing comment receives a click, append the text of the comment 
   into the textarea as a quotation (ie. "> Clicked comment.\n\n"). Give the 
   textarea focus.
   Hint: Since the comments are inserted dynamically, you will want to attach 
   the event listener to the parent div and have the events delegated to each 
   paragraph. Use the event object to determine which comment was clicked.

2. Whenever you add a comment, append an empty span with the class 'delete' to
   the comment paragraph. Add an click event listener for this span.
   
3. When the delete span is clicked:
    - delete the comment
    - ensure that the event does not bubble and the contents of the comment
      do NOT get added to the textarea as a quotation

4. Modify the comment counter so it will show the right count
